--------------------------
Exception Handle:
--------------------------
1. SQLException: 
    If the user try to create invalid request such as amount<0 when create symbol or limit<0 when create order, batabase will throw SQLException and we catch those exceptions to send an error line back as response
2. ParserException:
    If user send the file no in XML format, we could not parse the xml and print the error message
3. Others:
    For other exception like socket exception and XMl transforma exception, we print the error message

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Robust to security:
We are not allow user to query to cancel the order not within the account

Testing:
1. create request testing for both valid and not valid condition 
2. transaction request testing for valid order/quey/cancel, buy/sell price Matching
3. concurrency testing, we create 1000 threads to send the buy/sell request under the same account to confirm that those requests are not under data race and as a result show the same result as expection.
